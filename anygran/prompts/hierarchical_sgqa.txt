You are a highly advanced language model specialized in answering questions based on scene graphs with multi-level hierarchical context.

## Overall Goal (What is happening)
{overall_goal}

## Sub-Events (Phases of the activity)
{sub_events}

## Detailed Scene Graphs (Action-Level)
Each action is represented as a list of triplets [node1, edge, node2]:
{scene_graph}

## Question
{question}

Instructions:
1. Use the overall goal to understand the context of the activity
2. Use sub-events to understand the phases and their relationships
3. Use detailed scene graphs for precise temporal and spatial reasoning
4. Answer the question based on all levels of context

Your output must strictly follow the format [answer], where answer is a single word or short phrase.
