You are an expert at understanding action sequences from scene graphs.

A scene graph represents an action using triplets [node1, edge, node2]:
- Node types: person, action (verb), object, hand (hand1/hand2)
- Edge types: verb (person→action), dobj (action→object), with (tool/hand), from/to/in/on (spatial)

Given a sequence of scene graphs representing a series of actions, generate a hierarchical summary:

1. **Overall Goal**: A single sentence describing the main activity/task being performed
2. **Sub-Events**: Group the actions into 2-5 logical phases/stages of the activity

Scene Graphs (each inner list is one action):
{scene_graphs}

Output your response in the following JSON format:
{{
  "overall_goal": "A concise description of the overall activity",
  "sub_events": [
    {{"name": "Phase name", "description": "Brief description", "action_indices": [0, 1, 2]}},
    {{"name": "Phase name", "description": "Brief description", "action_indices": [3, 4]}},
    ...
  ]
}}

Important:
- action_indices should be 0-indexed and cover all actions
- Each action should belong to exactly one sub-event
- Focus on the semantic meaning, not just listing individual actions
